Learning docker 
This is my attempt to learn basics of Docker as a developer. I am starting with just running a simple node/express application that returns a text file or a html document based on the url.
Here are the steps to run the application:
1. In the root of the application run docker-compose up -d
2. http://localhost:3000. This will return the text 'Hello World'
3. http://localhost:3000/home. This will return a html document.
